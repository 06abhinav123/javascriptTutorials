    <!--Asynchronous program is a technique that enables your program to start a 
    potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that
    task run, rather than having to wait until that task has finished -->

    <!--The promise object represents the evnetualy completion (or failure) of an asynchronous
    operation .A promise object has 3 states:

    Pending: The async operation is going on
    Resolved: THe async operation is completed successfully
    Rejected: The async operation is completed with error -->
